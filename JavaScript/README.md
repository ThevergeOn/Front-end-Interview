### 1. What is JavaScript?
  JavaScript is a client-side and server-side scripting language inserted into HTML pages and is understood by web browsers. JavaScript is also an Object-based Programming language.
  
--- 
  
### 2. What are JavaScript Data Types?
   ##### Primitive types
   - Number
   - String
   - Boolean
   - BigInt
   - Undefined
   - Null
   - Symbol
   ##### Non-primitive types
   - Object
     ```
       Note- It is important to remember that any data type that is not primitive data type, is of Object type in javascript.
     ```

### 3. What's the output?

```javascript
function sayHi() {
  console.log(name);
  console.log(age);
  var name = 'Lydia';
  let age = 21;
}

sayHi();
```

- A: `Lydia` and `undefined`
- B: `Lydia` and `ReferenceError`
- C: `ReferenceError` and `21`
- D: `undefined` and `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

Within the function, we first declare the `name` variable with the `var` keyword. This means that the variable gets hoisted (memory space is set up during the creation phase) with the default value of `undefined`, until we actually get to the line where we define the variable. We haven't defined the variable yet on the line where we try to log the `name` variable, so it still holds the value of `undefined`.

Variables with the `let` keyword (and `const`) are hoisted, but unlike `var`, don't get <i>initialized</i>. They are not accessible before the line we declare (initialize) them. This is called the "temporal dead zone". When we try to access the variables before they are declared, JavaScript throws a `ReferenceError`.

### 4.  What are the possible ways to create objects in JavaScript

   There are many ways to create objects in javascript as below

   1. **Object constructor:**

      The simplest way to create an empty object is using the Object constructor. Currently this approach is not recommended.

      ```javascript
      var object = new Object();
      ```

   2. **Object's create method:**

      The create method of Object creates a new object by passing the prototype object as a parameter

      ```javascript
      var object = Object.create(null);
      ```

   3. **Object literal syntax:**

      The object literal syntax is equivalent to create method when it passes null as parameter

      ```javascript
      var object = {};
      ```

   4. **Function constructor:**

      Create any function and apply the new operator to create object instances,

      ```javascript
      function Person(name){
         this.name=name;
         this.age=21;
      }
      var object = new Person("Sudheer");
      ```

   5. **Function constructor with prototype:**

      This is similar to function constructor but it uses prototype for their properties and methods,

      ```javascript
      function Person(){}
      Person.prototype.name = "Sudheer";
      var object = new Person();
      ```

      This is equivalent to an instance created with an object create method with a function prototype and then call that function with an instance and parameters as arguments.

      ```javascript
      function func {};

      new func(x, y, z);
      ```

      **(OR)**

      ```javascript
      // Create a new instance using function prototype.
      var newInstance = Object.create(func.prototype)

      // Call the function
      var result = func.call(newInstance, x, y, z),

      // If the result is a non-null object then use it otherwise just use the new instance.
      console.log(result && typeof result === 'object' ? result : newInstance);
      ```

   6. **ES6 Class syntax:**

      ES6 introduces class feature to create the objects

      ```javascript
      class Person {
         constructor(name) {
            this.name = name;
         }
      }

      var object = new Person("Sudheer");
      ```

   7. **Singleton pattern:**

      A Singleton is an object which can only be instantiated one time. Repeated calls to its constructor return the same instance and this way one can ensure that they don't accidentally create multiple instances.

      ```javascript
      var object = new function(){
         this.name = "Sudheer";
      }
      ```

### 5.What's the output?

```javascript
const shape = {
  radius: 10,
  diameter() {
    return this.radius * 2;
  },
  perimeter: () => 2 * Math.PI * this.radius,
};

console.log(shape.diameter());
console.log(shape.perimeter());
```

- A: `20` and `62.83185307179586`
- B: `20` and `NaN`
- C: `20` and `63`
- D: `NaN` and `63`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

Note that the value of `diameter` is a regular function, whereas the value of `perimeter` is an arrow function.

With arrow functions, the `this` keyword refers to its current surrounding scope, unlike regular functions! This means that when we call `perimeter`, it doesn't refer to the shape object, but to its surrounding scope (window for example).

There is no value `radius` on that object, which returns `NaN`.

### 6.Which one is true?

```javascript
const bird = {
  size: 'small',
};

const mouse = {
  name: 'Mickey',
  small: true,
};
```

- A: `mouse.bird.size` is not valid
- B: `mouse[bird.size]` is not valid
- C: `mouse[bird["size"]]` is not valid
- D: All of them are valid

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

In JavaScript, all object keys are strings (unless it's a Symbol). Even though we might not _type_ them as strings, they are always converted into strings under the hood.

JavaScript interprets (or unboxes) statements. When we use bracket notation, it sees the first opening bracket `[` and keeps going until it finds the closing bracket `]`. Only then, it will evaluate the statement.

`mouse[bird.size]`: First it evaluates `bird.size`, which is `"small"`. `mouse["small"]` returns `true`

However, with dot notation, this doesn't happen. `mouse` does not have a key called `bird`, which means that `mouse.bird` is `undefined`. Then, we ask for the `size` using dot notation: `mouse.bird.size`. Since `mouse.bird` is `undefined`, we're actually asking `undefined.size`. This isn't valid, and will throw an error similar to `Cannot read property "size" of undefined`.

### 7. What's the output?

```javascript
let c = { greeting: 'Hey!' };
let d;

d = c;
c.greeting = 'Hello';
console.log(d.greeting);
```

- A: `Hello`
- B: `Hey!`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `ReferenceError`
- E: `TypeError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

In JavaScript, all objects interact by _reference_ when setting them equal to each other.

First, variable `c` holds a value to an object. Later, we assign `d` with the same reference that `c` has to the object.

When you change one object, you change all of them.

### 8. What's the output?

```javascript
let a = 3;
let b = new Number(3);
let c = 3;

console.log(a == b);
console.log(a === b);
console.log(b === c);
```

- A: `true` `false` `true`
- B: `false` `false` `true`
- C: `true` `false` `false`
- D: `false` `true` `true`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

`new Number()` is a built-in function constructor. Although it looks like a number, it's not really a number: it has a bunch of extra features and is an object.

When we use the `==` operator, it only checks whether it has the same _value_. They both have the value of `3`, so it returns `true`.

However, when we use the `===` operator, both value _and_ type should be the same. It's not: `new Number()` is not a number, it's an **object**. Both return `false.`

### 9. What happens when we do this?

```javascript
function bark() {
  console.log('Woof!');
}

bark.animal = 'dog';
```

- A: Nothing, this is totally fine!
- B: `SyntaxError`. You cannot add properties to a function this way.
- C: `"Woof"` gets logged.
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

This is possible in JavaScript, because functions are objects! (Everything besides primitive types are objects)

A function is a special type of object. The code you write yourself isn't the actual function. The function is an object with properties. This property is invocable.

### 10. What is the difference between == and === operators ?

   JavaScript provides both strict(===, !==) and type-converting(==, !=) equality comparison. The strict operators take type of variable in consideration, while non-strict operators make type correction/conversion based upon values of variables. The strict operators follow the below conditions for different types,
   1. Two strings are strictly equal when they have the same sequence of characters, same length, and same characters in corresponding positions.
   2. Two numbers are strictly equal when they are numerically equal. i.e, Having the same number value.
      There are two special cases in this,
      1. NaN is not equal to anything, including NaN.
      2. Positive and negative zeros are equal to one another.
   3. Two Boolean operands are strictly equal if both are true or both are false.
   4. Two objects are strictly equal if they refer to the same Object.
   5. Null and Undefined types are not equal with ===, but equal with ==. i.e,
       null===undefined --> false but null==undefined --> true

   Some of the example which covers the above cases,

   ```javascript
   0 == false   // true
   0 === false  // false
   1 == "1"     // true
   1 === "1"    // false
   null == undefined // true
   null === undefined // false
   '0' == false // true
   '0' === false // false
   []==[] or []===[] //false, refer different objects in memory
   {}=={} or {}==={} //false, refer different objects in memory
   ```
